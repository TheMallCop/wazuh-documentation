Deploying with Ansible
============================

Ansible is an open source platform designed for automating tasks. It comes with Playbooks, a descriptive language based on YAML, that make easy to create and describe automation jobs. Also, Ansible communicates with every host over SSH, making it very secure. See `Ansible Overview <https://www.ansible.com/how-ansible-works>`_ for more info.
